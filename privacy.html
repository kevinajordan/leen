        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

This privacy policy informs users of the app Leen (also called the Service) how Leen (also called us/we) gathers and uses personal information submitted in the App and aggregated information collected from the website and the app. By your use of the Service, you understand and agree that we provide a platform that you may use to access content, including measurements and underlying images, and other materials (“User Content” or “Your Content”), on the Service.
If we make material changes, as determined by us, in the way in which Personal Data is collected, used or transferred, we will notify you of these changes inside the Leen App and by posting a modified version of this Privacy Policy in the Leen App and on our website.
We are constantly improving this Privacy Policy to stay clear and easy to understand. You should always feel confident that your privacy is our highest priority. Please engage with this policy by sending us feedback at info@leen.com.
The protection of your Personal Data is of particular concern to us at Leen. Therefore, we comply with the legal requirements when we collect and process your Personal Data. Below you will find extensive information about the scope and purpose of collecting data.
<h2>How we protect Your Personal Data</h2>
Leen protects your privacy and always protects your Personal Data with the technical and organizational measures that are required in each case and ensures that the treatment is in accordance with applicable law.
<h2>Personal Data that You Provide</h2>
When taking measurements you store your underlying photos so that you can trace back your measurements. These photos are only directly accessible by you.
This is a necessary step for providing the Service and gives you transparency and compatibility over time.
<h2>How We Process Your Personal Data and for how long</h2>
The automatic, by Machine Learning, measurement analysis, is done without any human intervention.
Averaging of personal and non-personal data for you and others to get a benchmark is only done after anonymization. This means that measurements of, for example, your upper arm, are mixed with that of all other users and can not be traced back to you. When the underlying photos are used for the averaging or for machine learning training, these are done after anonymization of the photos and with no traceability, in order to improve the Service or for new features. Photos are cut at the shoulders, separating identifiable features from the measured body.
Your Personal Data is only retained as long as it is needed to provide you with the Service. After this period the Personal Data is permanently deleted.
<h2>Personal Data that is collected by Your device</h2>
We use a number of tools to improve and monitor the overall performance of Leen. All these tools are a necessity in providing the service, to always give and improve a useful and smooth experience.
The personal data involves:
<br />
– Device Identifier, a unique number assigned to your Leen installation which is only the same within the same tool.
<br />
– IP address, geo-coded to a city and kept for 10 seconds before being permanently deleted.
<br />
These tools do not have access to your Personal Data inside of the Leen App.
<h2>Personal Data that you don’t share</h2>
<h4>GPS location is not collected</h4>
<p>
If you allow GPS location, this is never recorded. When pairing with Fitness Centers, your GPS location is anonymously sent to Foursquare to gather a list of Centers nearby. If you have added centers, the phone will check if you are at any of these locations when taking your measurements. This will return the value of true or false. This means that if you are using Leen at home to take measurements, it will only be registered as not being at a Fitness Center.
Email and phone number are not collected
In the rare circumstances that automatic connection between your phone and the app fails, we offer to sign in using Account Kit. The temporary access code is distributed by email or SMS, but your contact information is not stored or processed by us.
If you seek help or send us feedback through email or SMS, we don’t store your contact information.</p>
<h2>Storage and transfer of Personal Data</h2>
Your Personal Data is stored and safeguarded in EU and in the USA. Meaning that, for EU citizens, data is transferred to a third-party country. All storage is in accordance with EU laws on privacy and data protection.
<h2>Protection of Children’s Privacy</h2>
Leen is a general interest Service meant for everyone. However, we do not allow users under the age of 13, or the equivalent minimum age in the relevant jurisdiction, to use the Service. Leen LLC does not knowingly collect personal information from children through this Service.
If you are a parent with concerns about children’s privacy issues in conjunction with the use of this Service, please contact us at privacy@leenapp.com.
